The postfix-doc package contains documentation on how to configure this
map type.  See /usr/share/doc/postfix/html/LDAP_README.html

To use ldaps maps, you will need to have access to /dev/random and
/dev/urandom.  Either create them in the chroot, or use a proxy: map to
escape the chroot for lookups.
